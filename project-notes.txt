Design idea

Steps:

1. Server revices post request from client containing the boardConfig json object and is then deserilized 
into the currentBoardConfig java object using jackson library.

2. a board is built in the main method - the board constructor will use the currentBoardConfig java object 
as an arg to build and add pieces to corresponding square objects.

3. Valid moves mthod is run and results are used to generate a new legalMoves java object.
